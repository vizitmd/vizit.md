## Deploy with Gulp

You can easily deploy your site build to a gh-pages branch. First, follow the instructions at [gulp-gh-pages](https://github.com/rowoot/gulp-gh-pages) to get your branch prepared for the deployment and to install the module. Then, in `gulpfile.js` you'll want to include something like the code below. `gulp.src()` needs to be the path to your final site folder, which by default will be `_site`. If you change the `destination` in your `_config.yml` file, be sure to reflect that in your gulpfile.



```javascript
var deploy = require("gulp-gh-pages");

gulp.task("deploy", ["jekyll-build"], function () {
    return gulp.src("./_site/**/*")
        .pipe(deploy());
});
```
